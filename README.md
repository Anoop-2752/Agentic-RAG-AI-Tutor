**Goal / Problem Statement:**
-
Students often struggle to understand step-by-step math solutions.
We need an AI Math Professor that:

1. Answers mathematical questions with clear, step-wise explanations.

2. First checks a curated knowledge base for verified solutions.

3. If the answer isnâ€™t there, safely performs a web/MCP search and generates a correct, well-cited solution.

4. Learns from human feedback to improve future answers.
